/**
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 * INSTALL.PHP – Initialization of Required PHP Extensions
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * This script checks if PHP is installed and if its version is 
 * greater than or equal to 8.1. It automatically detects the operating 
 * system (Windows, Linux, macOS) and adjusts the PHP extension 
 * verification accordingly.
 *
 * - ✅ Never modifies the installed PHP version
 * - ✅ Does not alter already installed or commented extensions
 * - ✅ Does not uncomment extensions on Windows if they are already declared
 * - ✅ Does not break any existing configurations
 * - ✅ Secure installation, adapted to the environment
 * - ✅ Composer update via `dump-autoload` only
 *
 * This file is intended to be integrated into a larger installer, 
 * typically as part of the Epaphrodites framework or a modular 
 * project based on custom PHP extensions.
